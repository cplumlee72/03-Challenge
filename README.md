# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description
This is a rudimentary password generator that, after clicking the generate button, goes through several 
prompts to ask how long the user wants their password to be, and if the user wants specific sets of 
characters included in their password. It stores those selections and then runs a function on the data 
stored to pick a set number of randomized characters based on the length of password set by the user. 
It then outputs the password to a text field so that it can be copied by the user. 



## Usage 

- Open a broswer. Navigate to [https://cplumlee72.github.io/Module-3-Challenge/](https://cplumlee72.github.io/Module-3-Challenge/)

- Click on the Generate Password Button to begin the process. 

- Enter how many characters you would like in your password when prompted.

- Click on OK or Cancel when asked if you would like lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, or specials characters in your password.
